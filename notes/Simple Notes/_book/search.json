Death, like the exposion of a bom is a non-reversible event. \nAny physical phenomena evolving in time, that presents an oscilatory behaviour, circular motion, a periodicity, can be translated in a time domain.\nThroughout history, Human civilizations have left us a lasting symbolism attached to circular shapes.

As an introductory and naive approach, it seemed relevant to seek technical definitions, and understand the underlaying concepts of such core ideas. Sir Isaac Newton, in Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, based his description of planetary motions, introducion the notion of a medium allowing this particular set of dynamic interaction. %In his aether model, Newton describes aether as a medium that “flows” continually downward toward the Earth’s surface and is partially absorbed and partially diffused. This “circulation” of aether is what he associated the force of gravity with to help explain the action of gravity in a non-mechanical fashion.\nThe brilliance on which today’s knowledge thrives, gave us the following idea on the continuos motion of Nature:\nMoreover, any sustainable dynamic system can be described has having a core cyclic pricipal, and most of those observable or inferred dynamics comprehend the fundamental elements of the universe we know.\nCylcles\nThe relationship between motion and sound has extensively been explored, in \"Musica Universalis\" (music of the spheres) explores the theory originated in Antient Greece, developed by 16th-century astronomer Johannes Kepler. Kepler did not believe this \"music\" to be audible, but felt that it could nevertheless be heard by the soul. The idea continued to appeal to scholars until the end of the Renaissance, influencing many schools of thought, including humanism.\n\nIt represents the notions of totality, wholeness, original perfection, the Self, the infinite, eternity, timelessness, all cyclic movement, God (‘God is a circle whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere’ (Hermes Trismegistus)).\nRoblee, Mark. “Performing Circles in Ancient Egypt from Mehen to Ouroboros.” Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural 7, no. 2 (2018): 133–53. https://doi.org/10.5325/preternature.7.2.0133.\n\nCycle is an ambiguous term for the unit of frequency or hertz, since 1960 when the International system of Units replaced one for the other. Nonetheless, there seems to be an intimate correlation between the time period of a cycle, and a circle.\nThe frequency domian, in analysing signals, it’s seems to be as relevant, in Nature ans teh Time domain, humans have found that the domain of frquencies as as usefull to descrive phenome.\nWaves If oscilatory behavior can be parametised, what then are the caratcteristic or information they may convey?\nWaves and wake-like patterns display:\n variance\n periodicity\n range\n finite or continuous nature\n speed\nFocusing on pressure waves, a signal a pulse, act as a disturbance moving through air. This disturbance transports energy, as particles are traveling subjects.\nFrequency\nthere are different ways to compute the frequency of a phenomena, in the context of this paper, the frequency of teh signal can be measured according the information or data available:\nf = 1 / T\nF = V / lambda\nf = angular frw / 2 pi\n\n\n\nRelationship FIG"

This “circulation” of aether is what he associated the force of gravity with to help explain the action of gravity in a non-mechanical fashion. Kepler had a mystical belief that the circle was the Universe’s perfect shape, and that as a manifestation of Divine order, the planets’ orbits must be circular. For many years, he struggled to make Brahe’s observations of the motions of Mars match up with a circular orbit.\nEventually, however, Kepler noticed that an imaginary line drawn from a planet to the Sun swept out an equal area of space in equal times, regardless of where the planet was in its orbit. If you draw a triangle out from the Sun to a planet’s position at one point in time and its position at a fixed time later—say, 5 hours, or 2 days—the area of that triangle is always the same, anywhere in the orbit. For all these triangles to have the same area, the planet must move more quickly when it is near the Sun, but more slowly when it is farthest from the Sun.\nThis discovery (which became Kepler’s second law of orbital motion) led to the realization of what became Kepler’s first law: that the planets move in an ellipse (a squashed circle) with the Sun at one focus point, offset from the center.\nBy unifying all motion, Newton shifted the scientific perspective to a search for large, unifying patterns in nature. Newton outlined his laws in Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (“Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,”) published in 1687.\nLaw I. Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed theron.\nIn essence, a moving object won’t change speed or direction, nor will a still object start moving, unless some outside force acts on it. The law is regularly summed up in one word: inertia.\nLaw II. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\nNewton’s second law is most recognizable in its mathematical form, the iconic equation: F=ma. The strength of the force (F) is defined by how much it changes the motion (acceleration, a) of an object with some mass (m).\nLaw III. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.\nAs Newton himself described: “If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone.”\n\n\n\nIsaac Newton demonstrated his universal law of gravitation by showing that a comet visible during 1680 and 1681 followed the path of a parabola. [Adapted from Isaac Newton, 1687. Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (“Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.”)]\n\n\nEinstein and Relativity The ideas outlined in Newton’s laws of motion and universal gravitation stood unchallenged for nearly 220 years until Albert Einstein presented his theory of special relativity in 1905. Newton’s theory depended on the assumption that mass, time, and distance are constant regardless of where you measure them.\nThe theory of relativity treats time, space, and mass as fluid things, defined by an observer’s frame of reference. All of us moving through the universe on the Earth are in a single frame of reference, but an astronaut in a fast-moving spaceship would be in a different reference frame."
