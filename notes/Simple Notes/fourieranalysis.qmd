As part of Harmonic Analysis, Fourier Analysis is composed by four variants:

-     Fourier Series
-     Fourier Transform
-     Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
-     Discrete Fourier transform

The current study session is dedicated to Fourier Transforms, a beautiful mathematical generalized tool of a decomposition process, taking an input recorded from a temporal perspective, Time Domain, to a filtered viewpoint of its components and attributes, Frequency Domain.

Here it is an outlined scenario:

- Air pressure, occurs at rate x per second
- Considering a binary system of information categorized by the states : 
    - on and off, 
    - when represented in terms of time and captured as a snapshot
    - would possibly register as illustrated as:

```bash
state
        on  |        _______
            |       |       |
            |       |       |
        off |_______|_______|___________ 
            0       1       2       3      t in seconds
```

The previous abstraction suggests that a horizontal axis in a two-dimensional space, represents time, measure in seconds, and the vertical axis represents the state [0,1]

Considering an input which alters its state once every two seconds:
    - The time period this vibrating body is 0.5 seconds
    - Being the "time period" the time of a full cycle
        - or the time it takes for the change between zero and one, given a moment.

If we imagine this oscillation between states as point continuously moving through around a circle, the center of this circle representing the *off state*, and the radius *the on* state, the speed that takes the point over a full cycle around a circle, the movement from one state to the other, appears to be correlated with the shape of a wave, but wrapped around on itself.
