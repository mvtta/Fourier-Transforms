## Notes on:

Motion

    The individual human experience is not cyclical, we're part of a group of phenomena which happens in a linear (one direction) trajectory towrds decay and eventual death. Death, like the exposion of a bom is a non-reversible event. 

Any physical phenomena evolving in time, that presents an oscilatory behaviour, circular motion, a periodicity, can be translated in a time domain.

Throughout history, Human civilizations have left us a lasting symbolism attached to circular shapes. Through drawing, cravings, books and foundations of mathematics. The patterns of celestial bodies in the sky, rivers flowing into oceans turn to rain and flooding rivers. Many dedicated their lives to uncover the mysteries of this powerful idea.

On what ground are the Fourier tools laid upon? The answer depends, of the desired output. As an introductory and naive approach, it seemed relevant to seek technical definitions, and understand the underlaying concepts of such core ideas. Sir Isaac Newton, in Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, based his description of planetary motions, introducion the notion of a medium allowing this particular set of dynamic interaction. 
%In his aether model, Newton describes aether as a medium that "flows" continually downward toward the Earth's surface and is partially absorbed and partially diffused. This "circulation" of aether is what he associated the force of gravity with to help explain the action of gravity in a non-mechanical fashion.

The brilliance on which today's knowledge thrives, gave us the following idea on the continuos motion of Nature:

Moreover, any sustainable dynamic system can be described has having a core cyclic pricipal, and most of those observable or inferred dynamics comprehend the fundamental elements of the universe we know.

Cylcles

    The relationship between motion and sound has extensively been explored, in "Musica Universalis" (music of the spheres) explores the theory originated in Antient Greece, developed by 16th-century astronomer Johannes Kepler. Kepler did not believe this "music" to be audible, but felt that it could nevertheless be heard by the soul. The idea continued to appeal to scholars until the end of the Renaissance, influencing many schools of thought, including humanism.

It represents the notions of totality, wholeness, original perfection, the Self, the infinite, eternity, timelessness, all cyclic movement, God ('God is a circle whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere' (Hermes Trismegistus)).

<!-- Rotation, air and sound -->
Cycle is an ambiguous term for the unit of frequency or hertz, since 1960 when the International system of Units replaced one for the other. Nonetheless, there seems to be an intimate correlation between the time period of a cycle, and a circle. 

The frequency domian, in analysing signals, it's seems to be as relevant, in Nature ans teh Time domain, humans have found that the domain of frquencies as as usefull to descrive phenome.

Waves 
    If oscilatory behavior can be parametised, what then are the caratcteristic or information they may convey?

Waves and wake-like patterns display:

     variance
     periodicity
     range
     finite or continuous nature
     speed


Focusing on pressure waves, a signal a pulse, act as a disturbance moving through air. 
This disturbance transports energy, as particles are traveling subjects.



Frequency

there are different ways to compute the frequency of a phenomena, in the context of this paper, the frequency of teh signal can be measured according the information or data available:

    f = 1 / T
    F = V / lambda
    f = angular frw / 2 pi
