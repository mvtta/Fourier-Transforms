* Amplitude: maximum distance between
     the horizontal axis and the vertical position of the waveform.
     * A sine wave with an amplitude
     of 5 V, for example, has a maximum value of +5 V and a minimum value of –5 V  
* Frequency: how quickly the sinusoid completes full cycles
    * influences the maximum rate at which a sinusoidal signal can transmit information  
* Phase: the horizontal position of a waveform with
    respect to one cycle  
    * Phase shift / Phase difference: signal is shifted
           to the left or right relative to another signal or to a theoretical reference signal

An unmodified expression of the type f(x) = sin(x) or f(x) = cos(x) will produce a sinusoidal waveform, but how do we account for the fact that sinusoidal voltage and current signals have different amplitudes, frequencies, and phase shifts?
these characteristics can be incorporated as parameters into mathematical expressions built around sin() or cos().

Amplitude is denoted by the letter A, frequency by f, and phase by the Greek letter ϕ (phi). The independent variable is time, denoted by t. Everything is arranged as follows


$$
f(t)=Asin(2πft+ϕ) or f(t)=Acos(2πft+ϕ)\
$$
