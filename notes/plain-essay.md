Considering a binary system of information categorized by the states : on and off, when represented in terms of time and captured as a snapshot, would possibly register as illustrated on the figure [n_of_figure](www.ola.com)

The previous abstraction suggests that along an horizontal axis in a two-dimensional space, representing time measure in seconds, and a vertical axis representing the state [0,1]

Considering an input which alters it's state once every two seconds, 

```bash
state
        on  |        _______
            |       |       |
            |       |       |
        off |_______|_______|___________ 
            0       1       2       3      t in seconds
```

In this its's also valid to describe, ie: the time period of a vibrating body as 0.5 seconds,
being the "time period", the time of a full cycle, or the time it takes for the change between zero and one, given a moment.

Circles and cycles

The musica universalis (literally universal music), also called music of the spheres or harmony of the spheres, is a philosophical concept that regards proportions in the movements of celestial bodies – the Sun, Moon, and planets – as a form of music. The theory, originating in ancient Greece, was a tenet of Pythagoreanism, and was later developed by 16th-century astronomer Johannes Kepler. Kepler did not believe this "music" to be audible, but felt that it could nevertheless be heard by the soul. The idea continued to appeal to scholars until the end of the Renaissance, influencing many schools of thought, including humanism.

“the music of the spheres.”

Cycle is an ambiguous term for the unit of frequency or hertz, since 1960 when the International system of Units replaced one for the other. Nonetheless, there seems to be an intimate correlation between the time period of a cycle, and a circle. 

In a two dimensional circular motion, a point can preform a cycle around a circle.
The center of a circle is the off state, and it's radius the on state. The speed that takes a for a full cycle around a circle, the alteration from one state to the other, is a beautiful idea to think about frequency.

This brings us to the sine wave, and the higher the velocity around the circle, the higher the frequency.

there are different ways to compute the frequency of a phenomena, in the context of this paper, the frequency of teh signal can be measured according the information or data available:

FRQUENCY domain:

The individual human experience is not cyclical, we're part of a group of phenomena which happens in a linear (one direction) trajectory towrds decay and eventual death. Death, like the exposion of a bom is a non-reversible event. 

The frequency domian, in analysing signals, it's seems to be as relevant, in Nature ans teh Time domain, humans have found that the domain of frquencies as as usefull to descrive phenome.



Signals:
sinusoldal signal receptors are commonly found in various forms in nature, thr inner ear of mammals, called cochlea, detecs air pressure sunusoids and frquencies between 20 and 20 khz.
The HUman retina also is sensitive to electromagnetic sinusois in a 430THz - 790THz range.  

the hability do detect sinusoidal  signals is intrinsicly related with performin a Fourier transoform, after all, science is the art od observation, deductiion and induction.

Signals aren't often pure as a sinusoid, and normaly are composed by diferent frquenc ressonations. The human ear, the cochlea, can receive at the "same time" varying inputs, and for example the brain, is somehow instuitivle able to decompose input into differen elements within the range of available perception.

Many have wondered if it would be possible to capture these signals and find it's elements, but in a time domain, pressure waves contain artifacts, and if register and then plotted, the shape it draws is rendered complex and even chaotic, like an array of montains in the horizon.

Decomposition of any signal into sinusoidal elements, can intuitivle be deduced as some sort of filtering processing. 
Therefore, signal processing must include a method to implemet teh right filters for the elements relevan for teh analysi at hand. 

The importance of the right filter for each case can be illustrate by takin a milkshake, made by blending banana and other fruits, to detect teh fruit banana, this diseign filter for such has to be included in the method, other wise dillution of this element can "mask" the rest of the elelemnts. 

Stil on thi milkshake idea, a extremely imporat concept,  the time-invarience, represents a core configurationof signal procesing. After decomposing a milksahe into it's recipe, all its components can then be again blended togheter no matter the order in which the elementes are inserted. 

From an Synthetizing prepective, blending ingredients into the smoothie represents tgoing from the frequency domain to the time domain, and from an alanytical stand point, finding the elements of the recipe is mpving from the time domain to a frquency domain.


Time and prespective:

A chnage in perception has been discussed since the beggining of time as a tool to reveal new observations. 
Claim : considering finite len signals, the set of N signals in C ^ N:

Drawing from cultic literature and iconography, this article examines the use of encirclement and circular imagery in ancient Egypt—ritual circumambulation, circular knots and jewelry, painted papyri, encircling utterances, and especially the apotropaic serpentine figure Mehen, who prefigured the ouroboros in Byzantine, Arabic, Jewish, and early modern European thought. Encirclement and circular imagery were performative in the ancient Egyptian context, functioning on a personal, psychological level as much as a shared, social level. Performing circles was an inner ritual or imaginative technology of self-transformation for the ancient Egyptian ritual practitioner and audience alike.

Acknowledging your limitations
Your conclusions should be directly supported by the data that you present. Avoid making sweeping conclusions that rest on assumptions that have not been substantiated by your or others’ research. For example, if you discover a correlation between fur thickness and basal metabolic rate in rats and mice you would not necessarily conclude that fur thickness and basal metabolic rate are correlated in all mammals. You might draw this conclusion, however, if you cited evidence that correlations between fur thickness and basal metabolic rate are also found in twenty other mammalian species. Assess the generality of the available data before you commit to an overly general conclusion.

Why:
Reveal, identify and manipulate diferent eleemts in a signal. 

How:
Changing prespective, proposing an evaluation for every possible element and testing for such. 
Decomposition types
impulse decomposition and Fourier decomposition.
two major decompositions, along with three minor ones.
impulse decomposition breaks an N samples signal into N component signals, each containing N samples. Each of the component signals contains one point from the original signal, with the remainder of the values being zero. A single nonzero point in a string of zeros is called an impulse. Impulse decomposition is important because it allows signals to be examined one sample at a time. Similarly, systems are characterized by how they respond to impulses. By knowing how a system responds to an impulse, the system's output can be calculated for any given input. This approach is called convolution, and is the topic of the next two chapters.

Step Decomposition
Step decomposition, shown in Fig. 5-13, also breaks an N sample signal into N component signals, each composed of N samples. Each component signal is a step, that is, the first samples have a value of zero, while the last samples are some constant value. Consider the decomposition of an N point signal, x[n], into the components: x0[n], x1[n], x2[n], …, xN-1[n]. The kth component signal, xk[n], is composed of zeros for points 0 through k - 1, while the remaining points have a value of: x[k] - x[k-1]. For example, the 5th component signal, x5[n], is composed of zeros for points 0 through 4, while the remaining samples have a value of: x[5] - x[4] (the difference between

![Alt text](https://www.dspguide.com/graphics/F_5_12.gif)

Even/Odd Decomposition
The even/odd decomposition, shown in Fig. 5-14, breaks a signal into two component signals, one having even symmetry and the other having odd symmetry. An N point signal is said to have even symmetry if it is a mirror image around point N/2. That is, sample x[N/2 + 1] must equal x[N/2 - 1], sample x[N/2 + 2] must equal x[N/2 - 2], etc. Similarly, odd symmetry occurs when the matching points have equal magnitudes but are opposite in sign, such as: x[N/2 + 1] = -x[N/2 - 1], x[N/2 + 2] = -x[N/2 - 2], etc. These definitions assume that the signal is composed of an even number of samples, and that the indexes run from 0 to N-1. The decomposition is calculated form the relations:

This may seem a strange definition of left-right symmetry, since N/2 - ½ (between two samples) is the exact center of the signal, not N/2. Likewise, this off-center symmetry means that sample zero needs special handling. What's this all about?

This decomposition is part of an important concept in DSP called circular symmetry. It is based on viewing the end of the signal as connected to the beginning of the signal. Just as point x[4] is next to point x[5], point x[N-1] is next to point x[0]. Picture a snake biting its own tail. When even and odd signals are viewed in this circular manner, there are actually two lines of symmetry, one at point x[N/2] and another at point x[0]. For example, in an even signal, this symmetry around x[0] means that point x[1] equals point x[N-1], point x[2] equals point x[N-2], etc. In an odd signal, point 0 and point N/2 always have a value of zero. In an even signal, point 0 and point N/2 are equal to the corresponding points in the original signal.

What is the motivation for viewing the last sample in a signal as being next to the first sample? There is nothing in conventional data acquisition to support this circular notion. In fact, the first and last samples generally have less in common than any other two points in the sequence. It's common sense! The missing piece to this puzzle is a DSP technique called Fourier analysis. The mathematics of Fourier analysis inherently views the signal as being circular, although it usually has no physical meaning in terms of where the data came from. We will look at this in more detail in Chapter 10. For now, the important thing to understand is that Eq. 5-1 provides a valid decomposition, simply because the even and odd parts can be added together to reconstruct the original signal.

Chapter 5: Linear Systems
Common Decompositions
Keep in mind that the goal of this method is to replace a complicated problem with several easy ones. If the decomposition doesn't simplify the situation in some way, then nothing has been gained. There are two main ways to decompose signals in signal processing: impulse decomposition and Fourier decomposition. There are described in detail in the next several chapters. In addition, several minor decompositions are occasionally used. Here are brief descriptions of the two major decompositions, along with three minor ones.

Impulse Decomposition
As shown in Fig. 5-12, impulse decomposition breaks an N samples signal into N component signals, each containing N samples. Each of the component signals contains one point from the original signal, with the remainder of the values being zero. A single nonzero point in a string of zeros is called an impulse. Impulse decomposition is important because it allows signals to be examined one sample at a time. Similarly, systems are characterized by how they respond to impulses. By knowing how a system responds to an impulse, the system's output can be calculated for any given input. This approach is called convolution, and is the topic of the next two chapters.

Step Decomposition
Step decomposition, shown in Fig. 5-13, also breaks an N sample signal into N component signals, each composed of N samples. Each component signal is a step, that is, the first samples have a value of zero, while the last samples are some constant value. Consider the decomposition of an N point signal, x[n], into the components: x0[n], x1[n], x2[n], …, xN-1[n]. The kth component signal, xk[n], is composed of zeros for points 0 through k - 1, while the remaining points have a value of: x[k] - x[k-1]. For example, the 5th component signal, x5[n], is composed of zeros for points 0 through 4, while the remaining samples have a value of: x[5] - x[4] (the difference between

sample 4 and 5 of the original signal). As a special case, x0[n] has all of its samples equal to x[0]. Just as impulse decomposition looks at signals one point at a time, step decomposition characterizes signals by the difference between adjacent samples. Likewise, systems are characterized by how they respond to a change in the input signal.

Even/Odd Decomposition
The even/odd decomposition, shown in Fig. 5-14, breaks a signal into two component signals, one having even symmetry and the other having odd symmetry. An N point signal is said to have even symmetry if it is a mirror image around point N/2. That is, sample x[N/2 + 1] must equal x[N/2 - 1], sample x[N/2 + 2] must equal x[N/2 - 2], etc. Similarly, odd symmetry occurs when the matching points have equal magnitudes but are opposite in sign, such as: x[N/2 + 1] = -x[N/2 - 1], x[N/2 + 2] = -x[N/2 - 2], etc. These definitions assume that the signal is composed of an even number of samples, and that the indexes run from 0 to N-1. The decomposition is calculated form the relations:

This may seem a strange definition of left-right symmetry, since N/2 - ½ (between two samples) is the exact center of the signal, not N/2. Likewise, this off-center symmetry means that sample zero needs special handling. What's this all about?

This decomposition is part of an important concept in DSP called circular symmetry. It is based on viewing the end of the signal as connected to the beginning of the signal. Just as point x[4] is next to point x[5], point x[N-1] is next to point x[0]. Picture a snake biting its own tail. When even and odd signals are viewed in this circular manner, there are actually two lines of symmetry, one at point x[N/2] and another at point x[0]. For example, in an even signal, this symmetry around x[0] means that point x[1] equals point x[N-1], point x[2] equals point x[N-2], etc. In an odd signal, point 0 and point N/2 always have a value of zero. In an even signal, point 0 and point N/2 are equal to the corresponding points in the original signal.

What is the motivation for viewing the last sample in a signal as being next to the first sample? There is nothing in conventional data acquisition to support this circular notion. In fact, the first and last samples generally have less in common than any other two points in the sequence. It's common sense! The missing piece to this puzzle is a DSP technique called Fourier analysis. The mathematics of Fourier analysis inherently views the signal as being circular, although it usually has no physical meaning in terms of where the data came from. We will look at this in more detail in Chapter 10. For now, the important thing to understand is that Eq. 5-1 provides a valid decomposition, simply because the even and odd parts can be added together to reconstruct the original signal.

Interlaced Decomposition
As shown in Fig. 5-15, the interlaced decomposition breaks the signal into two component signals, the even sample signal and the odd sample signal (not to be confused with even and odd symmetry signals). To find the even sample signal, start with the original signal and set all of the odd numbered samples to zero. To find the odd sample signal, start with the original signal and set all of the even numbered samples to zero. It's that simple.

At first glance, this decomposition might seem trivial and uninteresting. This is ironic, because the interlaced decomposition is the basis for an extremely important algorithm in DSP, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The procedure for calculating the Fourier decomposition has been know for several hundred years. Unfortunately, it is frustratingly slow, often requiring minutes or hours to execute on present day computers. The FFT is a family of algorithms developed in the 1960s to reduce this computation time. The strategy is an exquisite example of DSP: reduce the signal to elementary components by repeated use of the interlace transform; calculate the Fourier decomposition of the individual components; synthesized the results into the final answer. The results are dramatic; it is common for the speed to be improved by a factor of hundreds or thousands.

Fourier Decomposition
Fourier decomposition is very mathematical and not at all obvious. Figure 5-16 shows an example of the technique. Any N point signal can be decomposed into N+2 signals, half of them sine waves and half of them cosine waves. The lowest frequency cosine wave (called xC0[n] in this illustration), makes zero complete cycles over the N samples, i.e., it is a DC signal. The next cosine components: xC1[n], xC2[n], and xC3[n], make 1, 2, and 3 complete cycles over the N samples, respectively. This pattern holds for the remainder of the cosine waves, as well as for the sine wave components. Since the frequency of each component is fixed, the only thing that changes for different signals being decomposed is the amplitude of each of the sine and cosine waves.

Fourier decomposition is important for three reasons. First, a wide variety of signals are inherently created from superimposed sinusoids. Audio signals are a good example of this. Fourier decomposition provides a direct analysis of the information contained in these types of signals. Second, linear systems respond to sinusoids in a unique way: a sinusoidal input always results in a sinusoidal output. In this approach, systems are characterized by how they change the amplitude and phase of sinusoids passing through them. Since an input signal can be decomposed into sinusoids, knowing how a system will react to sinusoids allows the output of the system to be found. Third, the Fourier decomposition is the basis for a broad and powerful area of mathematics called Fourier analysis, and the even more advanced Laplace and z-transforms. Most cutting-edge DSP algorithms are based on some aspect of these techniques.

Why is it even possible to decompose an arbitrary signal into sine and cosine waves? How are the amplitudes of these sinusoids determined for a particular signal? What kinds of systems can be designed with this technique? These are the questions to be answered in later chapters. The details of the Fourier decomposition are too involved to be presented in this brief overview. For now, the important idea to understand is that when all of the component sinusoids are added together, the original signal is exactly reconstructed. Much more on this in Chapter 8.

Superposition:

When we are dealing with linear systems, the only way signals can be combined is by scaling (multiplication of the signals by constants) followed by addition. For instance, a signal cannot be multiplied by another signal. Figure 5-10 shows an example: three signals: x0[n], x1[n], and x2[n] are added to form a fourth signal, x[n]. This process of combining signals through scaling and addition is called synthesis.

Decomposition is the inverse operation of synthesis, where a single signal is broken into two or more additive components. This is more involved than synthesis, because there are infinite possible decompositions for any given signal. For example, the numbers 15 and 25 can only be synthesized (added) into the number 40. In comparison, the number 40 can be decomposed into: 1 + 39 or 2 + 38 or -30.5 + 60 + 10.5, etc.

Now we come to the heart of DSP: superposition, the overall strategy for understanding how signals and systems can be analyzed. Consider an inpu

gnal, called x[n], passing through a linear system, resulting in an output signal, y[n]. As illustrated in Fig. 5-11, the input signal can be decomposed into a group of simpler signals: x0[n], x1[n], x2[n], etc. We will call these the input signal components. Next, each input signal component is individually passed through the system, resulting in a set of output signal components: y0[n], y1[n], y2[n], etc. These output signal components are then synthesized into the output signal, y[n].

Here is the important part: the output signal obtained by this method is identical to the one produced by directly passing the input signal through the system. This is a very powerful idea. Instead of trying to understanding how complicated signals are changed by a system, all we need to know is how simple signals are modified. In the jargon of signal processing, the input and output signals are viewed as a superposition (sum) of simpler waveforms. This is the basis of nearly all signal processing techniques.

As a simple example of how superposition is used, multiply the number 2041 by the number 4, in your head. How did you do it? You might have imagined 2041 match sticks floating in your mind, quadrupled the mental image, and started counting. Much more likely, you used superposition to simplify the problem. The number 2041 can be decomposed into: 2000 + 40 + 1. Each of these components can be multiplied by 4 and then synthesized to find the final answer, i.e., 8000 + 160 + 4 = 8164.

Common Decompositions
Keep in mind that the goal of this method is to replace a complicated problem with several easy ones. If the decomposition doesn't simplify the situation in some way, then nothing has been gained. There are two main ways to decompose signals in signal processing: impulse decomposition and Fourier decomposition. There are described in detail in the next several chapters. In addition, several minor decompositions are occasionally used. Here are brief descriptions of the two major decompositions, along with three minor ones.

Impulse Decomposition
As shown in Fig. 5-12, impulse decomposition breaks an N samples signal into N component signals, each containing N samples. Each of the component signals contains one point from the original signal, with the remainder of the values being zero. A single nonzero point in a string of zeros is called an impulse. Impulse decomposition is important because it allows signals to be examined one sample at a time. Similarly, systems are characterized by how they respond to impulses. By knowing how a system responds to an impulse, the system's output can be calculated for any given input. This approach is called convolution, and is the topic of the next two chapters.

Step Decomposition
Step decomposition, shown in Fig. 5-13, also breaks an N sample signal into N component signals, each composed of N samples. Each component signal is a step, that is, the first samples have a value of zero, while the last samples are some constant value. Consider the decomposition of an N point signal, x[n], into the components: x0[n], x1[n], x2[n], …, xN-1[n]. The kth component signal, xk[n], is composed of zeros for points 0 through k - 1, while the remaining points have a value of: x[k] - x[k-1]. For example, the 5th component signal, x5[n], is composed of zeros for points 0 through 4, while the remaining samples have a value of: x[5] - x[4] (the difference between

Homogeneity, additivity, and shift invariance are important because they provide the mathematical basis for defining linear systems. Unfortunately, these properties alone don't provide most scientists and engineers with an intuitive feeling of what linear systems are about. The properties of static linearity and sinusoidal fidelity are often of help here. These are not especially important from a mathematical standpoint, but relate to how humans think about and understand linear systems. You should pay special attention to this section.

Static linearity defines how a linear system reacts when the signals aren't changing, i.e., when they are DC or static. The static response of a linear system is very simple: the output is the input multiplied by a constant. That is, a graph of the possible input values plotted against the corresponding output values is a straight line that passes through the origin. This is shown in Fig. 5-5 for two common linear systems: Ohm's law for resistors, and Hooke's law for springs. For comparison, Fig. 5-6 shows the static relationship for two nonlinear systems: a pn junction diode, and the magnetic properties of iron.
